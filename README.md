This course was the basics of the python programming environment, including fundamental python programming techniques such as lambdas, reading and manipulating csv files, and the numpy library. It introduced data manipulation and cleaning techniques using pandas  library and introduced the abstraction of the Series and DataFrame as the central data structures for data analysis, along with usage of the functions such as groupby, merge, and pivot tables. 

In this repository all the required files are present to perform all the data manipulation tasks. All the items are defined as below
1. Weekly Practice Notebooks:
	
	1.a)  Week1.ipynb - It contains basic codes on string manilpulation, dataframe manipulation, datetime manipulation of how
to get used to basic python syntaxs and methods. (This file uses mpg.csv excelsheet also provided in the repo)

	1.b)  Week2.ipynb - It contains code in data manipulation using PANDAs. ( This file uses olympics.csv also provided in the repo)
	
	1.c)  Week3.ipynb - It contains code for DataFrame Creation and manipulation. ( This file uses census.csv also provided in the repo)
	
	1.d)  Week4.ipynb - It contains code for mathematical manipulations in PANDAs and NUMPY. ( This file uses grades.csv also provided in the repo)
